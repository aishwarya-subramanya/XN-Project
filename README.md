# XN-Project

Project Objective:

The main objective of the sponsorâ€™s project is to obtain trends, similarities, and differences within the given dataset of the US Millennial Persona.
As we perform Exploratory Data Analysis it is important to present the obtained findings into a presentable format such as interactive dashboards or a presentation so that, the insights could be made available to the respective stakeholders in order to make beneficial business decisions according to their internal requirements.

Since there are political terminologies as well as other topics or keywords associated in all of the personas, we will also be considering this and digging deeper in identifying the patterns and similarities within and across the different personas.

Business Questions:
We are trying to answer the following Business Questions,

1.	To analyze and identify patterns in the hot topics or features available in the US persona and also to derive relationship between the 6 US Millennials
2.	To identify  the methods and enhance the keyword search using Machine Learning Algorithms

Alongside the Business Questions, for each set of Analysis and Data Exploration we have formed the key problem statements and try to answer them with the help of statistical techniques and data visualization tools.
